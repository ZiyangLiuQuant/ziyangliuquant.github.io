<h2>About Me</h2>
<div class="about-flex">
  <img src="/assets/img/Liu-Ziyang_zl978_Headshot.jpg" alt="Leo Liu" />
  <div>
    I am <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-liu-adventurer/">Leo Ziyang Liu</a>, currently pursuing a 
    <a href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/orie/meng/financial-engineering-concentration/">Master of Engineering in Financial Engineering at Cornell University</a>.
    I previously earned a B.S. in Economics and Finance from Renmin University of China and a dual degree from KEDGE Business School in Bank and France. I also audited √âquations diff√©rentielles partielles, Th√©orie de la mesure and Processus stochastique at the Sorbonne University while I was in France.

    <br /><br />

    My research interests include quantitative strategies, market microstructure, statistical modeling, and applications of machine learning in finance. I have experience on the sell-side, buy-side, and prop trading desks.

  <h2>Education</h2>

  <div class="education-item">
    <img src="/assets/img/cornell.jpg" alt="Cornell" />
    <div>
      <strong>Cornell University</strong>, M.Eng. Financial Engineering
      <br />Aug. 2024 - Dec. 2025
      <br />Trained at the intersection of markets, math, and technology, I actively developed expertise in both quantitative methodology and practical implementation. On the technical side, I explored advanced toolkits including <em>Optimization Modeling, Machine Learning, and Stochastic Calculus</em>. I also delved into cutting-edge topics through courses like <em>Fixed Income Securities and Interest Rate Options</em> with <a href="https://business.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/raj15/">Prof. Robert Jarrow</a>  and <em>Market Microstructure and Algorithmic Trading</em> with <a href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/people/sasha-f-stoikov/">Prof. Sasha Stoikov</a>.
      <br />Beyond coursework, I collaborated with faculty on applied projects involving optimal execution, deep hedging of derivatives, and portfolio optimization. These experiences sharpened my ability to translate quantitative theory into trading-ready strategies under realistic constraints.
      <br />Through case-based seminars and team-driven research assignments, I further developed practical problem-solving skills and the ability to communicate technical ideas across collaborative environments‚Äîpreparing me to contribute effectively in fast-paced quant teams.

    <div>
      <strong>Renmin University of China</strong>, B.S. in Economics and Finance
      <br />Sep. 2020 - Jun. 2024
      <br />At Renmin University of China, I developed a strong economic and financial intuition, grounded in rigorous training in quantitative methods. The curriculum combined institutional economics, monetary theory, and public finance with mathematical foundations in probability, linear algebra, and statistics. 
      <br />This dual emphasis gave me both a structured understanding of how financial systems work and the tools to model them. I graduated in the top 5% of all graduates that year, received full merit-based scholarships, and actively applied programming skills in multiple programming languages to research-driven coursework.

      <strong>KEDGE Business School (France)</strong> ‚Äì B.B.A. in Bank &amp; Finance  
      <br />Sep. 2020 - Jun. 2023
      <br /> Studying at KEDGE expanded my international perspective on finance, ethics, and leadership. I engaged with the European approach to banking and regulation, complementing my prior training in China. 
      <br />This cross-cultural experience sharpened my adaptability and communication in diverse, multilingual teams. While in France, I also audited graduate-level courses at Sorbonne University, further strengthening my quantitative foundation in a global academic environment.

  <h2>Other</h2>
  <p>
    Outside of work, I balance intellectual intensity with physical challenges. I was a city sprint champion and am a decade-long marathon runner. I meditate regularly, play competitive poker, and have been invited to give a TEDx talk on discipline and data. These pursuits have helped me stay focused, resilient, and think probabilistically‚Äîboth on and off the trading floor.
